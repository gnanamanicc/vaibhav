							<a href="#">Biodiversity conservation</a>
							<p>Biodiversity conservation is the protection, management, and restoration of biological diversity, which includes all species of plants, animals, and microorganisms, as well as the ecosystems and habitats in which they live. Biodiversity is essential for the functioning of ecosystems and the provision of ecosystem services that are important for human well-being, including air and water purification, soil health, and climate regulation.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="services-grid">
							<a href="#">Ecosystem services</a>
							<p>Ecosystem services are the benefits that humans receive from the natural environment and its ecosystems. These services are critical for our well-being and are the foundation of our economies and societies. Provisioning services are the tangible products that we obtain from ecosystems, such as food, water, timber, and fuel. Regulating services are the services that help to regulate the environment, such as climate regulation, water purification, and pest control. Supporting services are the services that ecosystems provide to maintain the conditions for life, such as nutrient cycling, soil formation, and biodiversity. Finally, cultural services are the non-material benefits that we receive from ecosystems, such as recreation, aesthetic enjoyment, and spiritual and cultural values.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="services-grid">
							<a href="#"> Species conservation</a>
							<p>Species conservation is the protection and management of individual species, including threatened and endangered species, to prevent their extinction and promote their recovery. Species conservation is critical for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, as well as for the cultural and aesthetic value of individual species.

							Species conservation involves a range of activities, including habitat management and restoration, captive breeding and reintroduction, invasive species control, and public education and awareness. The ultimate goal of species conservation is to prevent the extinction of threatened and endangered species and to promote their recovery to a self-sustaining population size.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="services-grid">
							<a href="#">Habitat Management</a>
							<p>Habitat management is a key service in wildlife conservation that involves the restoration, preservation, and enhancement of habitats for wildlife populations. Wildlife habitats are critical for the survival and thriving of different species as they provide food, shelter, breeding sites, and migration routes. Habitat management practices aim to create or maintain a healthy and sustainable ecosystem that supports wildlife populations and their ecological functions.

							Habitat management practices may include reforestation, restoration of wetlands, removal of invasive species, controlled burns to prevent wildfires, and creation of wildlife corridors. Reforestation involves planting native tree species in areas where forests have been degraded or cleared. Restoration of wetlands involves the creation or restoration of wetland ecosystems to support waterfowl and other wetland-dependent species.</p>
