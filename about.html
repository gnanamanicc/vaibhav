							<a href="#">Wildlife conservation</a>
							<p>Wildlife conservation refers to the practice of protecting wild species and their habitats in order to maintain healthy wildlife species or populations and to restore, protect or enhance natural ecosystems. Major threats to wildlife include habitat destruction, degradation, fragmentation, overexploitation, poaching, pollution and climate change. The IUCN estimates that 27,000 species of the ones assessed are at risk for extinction. Expanding to all existing species, a 2019 UN report on biodiversity put this estimate even higher at a million species. It is also being acknowledged that an increasing number of ecosystems on Earth containing endangered species are disappearing. To address these issues, there have been both national and international governmental efforts to preserve Earth's wildlife. Prominent conservation agreements include the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). There are also numerous nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) dedicated to conservation such as the Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, the Wild Animal Health Fund and Conservation International.</p> <br>

							<p><b>The conservation of wildlife is necessary for prevention of drought, new deserts, fires as well as flood. Also, this conservation ensures that the upcoming generations of human and wildlife will be surrounded by nature thereby loving it and understanding the significance of wildlife. Also, wildlife acts as a gene pool for various resistant strains of pests causing the diseases. The production of food is also enhanced via wildlife. Various pollinating agents like birds, bats and bees help in increasing the productivity of plants. Moreover, wildlife also contributes as a medicinal source. Humans are benefitted from various species of microscopic animals, fungi, animals and plants in some or the other way. The wild plants species are responsible for the production of various pharmaceutical drugs.
							The study of interaction of various species with their ecosystem and the effect of human and environmental influences on the wildlife will help in conserving the wildlife.</b></p>
							<br>
							<h1>Species conservation</h1><br>
							<p><b>
								It is estimated that, because of human activities, current species extinction rates are about 1000 times greater than the background extinction rate (the 'normal' extinction rate that occurs without additional influence). According to the IUCN, out of all species assessed, over 27,000 are at risk of extinction and should be under conservation. Of these, 25% are mammals, 14% are birds, and 40% are amphibians.However, because not all species have been assessed, these numbers could be even higher. A 2019 UN report assessing global biodiversity extrapolated IUCN data to all species and estimated that 1 million species worldwide could face extinction. Yet, because resources are limited, sometimes it is not possible to give all species that need conservation due consideration. Deciding which species to conserve is a function of how close to extinction a species is, whether the species is crucial to the ecosystem it resides in, and how much we care about it.

						<br>
						<h1>Habitat conservation</h1><br>
						<p><b>
							Habitat conservation is the practice of protecting a habitat in order to protect the species within it. This is sometimes preferable to focusing on a single species especially if the species in question has very specific habitat requirements or lives in a habitat with many other endangered species. The latter is often true of species living in biodiversity hotspots, which are areas of the world with an exceptionally high concentration of endemic species (species found nowhere else in the world). Many of these hotspots are in the tropics, mainly tropical forests like the Amazon. Habitat conservation is usually carried out by setting aside protected areas like national parks or nature reserves. Even when an area isn't made into a park or reserve, it can still be monitored and maintained.
